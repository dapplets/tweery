Tweery is a dapplet that runs inside the browser on Twitter. Tweery effectively decentralizes Twitter's content and workflows.

This dapplet was created by the Dapplets Project Team as part of the HackFS Hackathon.

# Features
1. crawls tweets that are seen by users and stores them into IPFS on the fly.
2. restores deleted tweets from the IPFS storage on the fly.
3. creates an IPFS-based tweet and merges it into the author's timeline.
4. restores disabled reply/retweet functionality if disabled by twitter.

# Installation
Install the DappletsExtension to use this dapplet. Instructions can be found here:

# Tweery and Augmented Web Paradigm
Tweery demonstrates the idea of forced decentralization applied to an existing web-based service.
It breaks the monopoly of the community host and makes it possible for the community to gain self-sovereignty over its content and workflows.
